If you want to specify the amount of time that the Socket will attempt to transmit unsent data after closing, create a LingerOption with the enable parameter set to true, and the seconds parameter set to the desired amount of time. The seconds parameter is used to indicate how long you would like the Socket to remain connected before timing out. If you do not want the Socket to stay connected for any length of time after closing, create a LingerOption instance with the enable parameter set to true and the seconds parameter set to zero. In this case, the Socket will close immediately and any unsent data will be lost. Once created, pass the LingerOption to the Socket.SetSocketOption method. If you are sending and receiving data with a TcpClient, then set the LingerOption instance in the TcpClient.LingerState property.
