      /// @remarks ProcessStartInfo is used together with the Process component. When you start a process using the Process class, you have access to process information in addition to that available when attaching to a running process.
      /// @remarks You can use the ProcessStartInfo class for better control over the process you start. You must at least set the FileName property, either manually or using the constructor. The file name is any application or document. Here a document is defined to be any file type that has an open or default action associated with it. You can view registered file types and their associated applications for your computer by using the Folder Options dialog box, which is available through the operating system. The Advanced button leads to a dialog box that shows whether there is an open action associated with a specific registered file type.
      /// @remarks In addition, you can set other properties that define actions to take with that file. You can specify a value specific to the type of the FileName property for the Verb property. For example, you can specify "print" for a document type. Additionally, you can specify Arguments property values to be command-line arguments to pass to the file's open procedure. For example, if you specify a text editor application in the FileName property, you can use the Arguments property to specify a text file to be opened by the editor.
      /// @remarks Standard input is usually the keyboard, and standard output and standard error are usually the monitor screen. However, you can use the RedirectStandardInput, RedirectStandardOutput, and RedirectStandardError properties to cause the process to get input from or return output to a file or other device. If you use the StandardInput, StandardOutput, or StandardError properties on the Process component, you must first set the corresponding value on the ProcessStartInfo property. Otherwise, the system throws an exception when you read or write to the stream.
