      /// @remarks The TextWriterTraceListener class provides the Writer property to get or set the text writer that receives the tracing or debugging output.
      /// @remarks This class also provides methods to Close the Writer so that it no longer receives tracing or debugging output, to Flush the output buffer for the Writer, and to Write a message to the Writer.
      /// @remarks You must enable tracing or debugging to use a trace listener. The syntax is compiler specific. If you use other than cmake to manage your build, refer to the documentation of your build nanager.
      ///  * To enable debugging with cmake, add the add_definitions(-DDEBUG) command line in the CMakeLists.txt of your porject, or you can add #define DEBUG to the top of your file but in this case, the compiler options for debug is not activated.
      ///  * To enable tracing with cmake, add the add_definitions(-DTRACE) command line in the CMakeLists.txt of your porject, or you can add #define TRACE to the top of your file.
      /// @note If an attempt is made to write to a file that is in use or unavailable, the file name is automatically prefixed by a GUID.

      /// The following example implements an instance of the TextWriterTraceListener class that uses a StreamWriter called myOutputWriter to write to a file named TestFile.txt. First the example creates a file for output. Then it creates the StreamWriter for the first text writer, assigns it the output file, and adds it to the Listeners. Then, the code outputs one line of text to the file. Finally, the example flushes the output buffer.
