The operating system uses the base-priority level of all executable threads to determine which thread gets the next slice of processor time.
      /// @remarks Win32 uses four priority classes with seven base priority levels per class. Based on time elapsed or other boosts, the operating system can change the base priority level when a process needs to be put ahead of others for access to the processor. In addition, you can set PriorityBoostEnabled to temporarily boost the priority level of threads that have been taken out of the wait state. The priority is reset when the process returns to the wait state.
