    /// @remarks The DateTime value type represents dates and times with values ranging from 00:00:00 (midnight), January 1, 0001 Anno Domini (Common Era) through 11:59:59 P.M., December 31, 9999 A.D. (C.E.) in the Gregorian calendar.
    /// @remarks Time values are measured in 100-nanosecond units called ticks, and a particular date is the number of ticks since 12:00 midnight, January 1, 0001 A.D. (C.E.) in the GregorianCalendar calendar (excluding ticks that would be added by leap seconds). For example, a ticks value of 31241376000000000L represents the date, Friday, January 01, 0100 12:00:00 midnight. A DateTime value is always expressed in the context of an explicit or default calendar.
    /// @note If you are working with a ticks value that you want to convert to some other time interval, such as minutes or seconds, you should use the TimeSpan.TicksPerDay, TimeSpan.TicksPerHour, TimeSpan.TicksPerMinute, TimeSpan.TicksPerSecond, or TimeSpan.TicksPerMillisecond constant to perform the conversion. For example, to add the number of seconds represented by a specified number of ticks to the Second component of a DateTime value, you can use the expression dateValue.Second + nTicks/Timespan.TicksPerSecond.
    /// For example, a ticks value of 31241376000000000LL represents the date, Friday, January 01, 0100 12:00:00 midnight. A DateTime value is always expressed in the context of an explicit or default calendar.
    /// PInstantiating a DateTime object</b>
    /// You can create a new DateTime value in any of the following ways:
    ///    * By calling any of the overloads of the DateTime constructor that allow you to specify specific elements of the date and time value (such as the year, month, and day, or the number of ticks). The following statement illustrates a call to one of the DateTime constructors to create a date with a specific year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.
    /// @code
    /// DateTime date1(2008, 5, 1, 8, 30, 52);
    /// @endcode
    ///    * By assigning the DateTime object a date and time value returned by a property or method. The following example assigns the current date and time, the current Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) date and time, and the current date to three new DateTime variables.
    /// @code
    /// DateTime date1 = DateTime::Now;
    /// DateTime date2 = DateTime::UtcNow;
    /// DateTime date3 = DateTime::Today;
    /// @endcode
    ///    * By parsing the String representation of a date and time value. The Parse, ParseExact, TryParse, and TryParseExact methods all convert a String to its equivalent date and time value. The following example uses the Parse method to parse a String and convert it to a DateTime value.
    /// @code
    /// String dateString = "5/1/2008 8:30:52";
    /// DateTime date1 = DateTime::Parse(dateString);
    /// @endcode
    /// Note that the TryParse and TryParseExact methods indicate whether a particular String contains a valid representation of a DateTime value in addition to performing the conversion.
    ///    * By calling the DateTime structure's implicit default constructor. The following example illustrates a call to the DateTime implicit default constructor.
    /// @code
    /// DateTime dat1;
    /// // The following method call displays 1/01/0001 00:00:00.
    /// Console::WriteLine(dat1.ToString());
    /// // The following method call displays true.
