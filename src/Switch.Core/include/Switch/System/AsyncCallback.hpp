    /// @remarks Use an AsyncCallback delegate to process the results of an asynchronous operation in a separate thread. The AsyncCallback delegate represents a callback method that is called when the asynchronous operation completes. The callback method takes an IAsyncResult parameter, which is subsequently used to obtain the results of the asynchronous operation.
    /// @par Examples
    /// The following code example demonstrates using asynchronous methods in the Dns class to retrieve Domain Name System (DNS) information for user-specified computers. This example creates an AsyncCallback delegate that references the ProcessDnsInformation method. This method is called once for each asynchronous request for DNS information.

    /// @par Examples
    /// This example show how to used a specialized EventHandler.
