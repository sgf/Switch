    /// @brief Represents a pseudo-random number generator, a device that produces a sequence of numbers that meet certain statistical requirements for randomness.
    /// @par Library
    /// Switch.Core
    /// @remarks Pseudo-random numbers are chosen with equal probability from a finite set of numbers. The chosen numbers are not completely random because a definite mathematical algorithm is used to select them, but they are sufficiently random for practical purposes. The current implementation of the Random class is based on Donald E. Knuth's subtractive random number generator algorithm. For more information, see D. E. Knuth. "The Art of Computer Programming, volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms". Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, second edition, 1981.
    /// @remarks The random number generation starts from a seed value. If the same seed is used repeatedly, the same series of numbers is generated. One way to produce different sequences is to make the seed value time-dependent, thereby producing a different series with each new instance of Random. By default, the parameterless constructor of the Random class uses the system clock to generate its seed value, while its parameterized constructor can take an Int32 value based on the number of ticks in the current time. However, because the clock has finite resolution, using the parameterless constructor to create different Random objects in close succession creates random number generators that produce identical sequences of random numbers. The following example illustrates that two Random objects that are instantiated in close succession generate an identical series of random numbers.
    /// @include Random1.cpp
    /// @remarks This problem can be avoided by creating a single Random object rather than multiple ones.
    /// @remarks To improve performance, create one Random object to generate many random numbers over time, instead of repeatedly creating a new Random objects to generate one random number.
    /// @remarks To generate a cryptographically secure random number suitable for creating a random password, for example, use a class derived from System::Security::Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator such as System::Security::Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider.
    /// @par Notes to Callers
    /// The implementation of the random number generator in the Random class is not guaranteed to remain the same across major versions of the Switch. As a result, your application code should not assume that the same seed will result in the same pseudo-random sequence in different versions of the Switch.
    /// @par Notes to Inheritors
    /// In Switch, the behavior of the Random.Next(), Random::Next(int32, int32), and NextBytes methods have changed so that these methods do not necessarily call the derived class implementation of the Sample method. As a result, classes derived from Random that target the Switch should also virtual these three methods.
