    /// @remarks The TimeZoneInfo class offers significant enhancements over the TimeZone class, which provides only limited functionality.
    /// @remarks The TimeZone class recognizes only the local time zone, and can convert times between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and local time. A TimeZoneInfo object can represent any time zone, and methods of the TimeZoneInfo class can be used to convert the time in one time zone to the corresponding time in any other time zone. The members of the TimeZoneInfo class support the following operations:
    /// * Retrieving a time zone that is already defined by the operating system.
    /// * Enumerating the time zones that are available on a system.
    /// * Converting times between different time zones.
    /// * Creating a new time zone that is not already defined by the operating system.
    /// * Serializing a time zone for later retrieval.
    /// @note An instance of the TimeZoneInfo class is immutable. Once an object has been instantiated, its values cannot be modified.

      /// @remarks In most cases, the DaylightName property of time zones defined in the registry is not String.Empty or null. However, the DaylightName property of custom time zones can be set to String.Empty. This occurs when custom time zones are created by the TimeZoneInfo.CreateCustomTimeZone(String, TimeSpan, String, String) or the TimeZoneInfo.CreateCustomTimeZone(String, TimeSpan, String, String, String, TimeZoneInfo.AdjustmentRule[], Boolean) overload and the disableDaylightSavingTime parameter is true.
