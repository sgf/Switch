  /// Switch.Core
  /// @remarks It is a shared pointer-like type: The pointed exception is guaranteed to remain valid for as long as at least one exception_ptr points to it, potentially extending its lifetime beyond the scope of a catch statement or across threads.
  /// @remarks Different libraries may implement this type differently, but it shall at least support the following operations without throwing:
  /// * Being default-constructed (acquiring a null-pointer value).
  /// * Being copied, including being copied a null-pointer value (or null).
  /// * Being compared against another exception_ptr object (or null) using either operator== or operator!=, where two null-pointers are always considered equivalent, and two non-null pointers are considered equivalent only if they refer to the same exception object.
  /// * Being contextually convertible to bool, as false if having null-pointer value, and as true otherwise.
  /// * Being swapped, and being destructed.
  /// @remarks The type is also required to not be implicitly convertible to an arithmetic, enumeration, or pointer type.
  /// @remarks Performing any other operation on the object (such as dereferencing it), if at all supported by the library implementation, causes undefined behavior.
  /// @par Examples
