        /// @brief The Application class has methods to start and stop applications and threads, and to process Windows messages, as follows:
        /// * Run starts an application message loop on the current thread and, optionally, makes a form visible.
        /// * Exit or ExitThread stops a message loop.
        /// * DoEvents processes messages while your program is in a loop.
        /// * AddMessageFilter adds a message filter to the application message pump to monitor Windows messages.
        /// * IMessageFilter lets you stop an event from being raised or perform special operations before invoking an event handler.
        /// @remarks This class has CurrentCulture and CurrentInputLanguage properties to get or set culture information for the current thread.
        /// @remarks You cannot create an instance of this class.
        /// @par Example
        /// The following code example demonstrate the use of Application class.

          /// @remarks The Exit method stops all running message loops on all threads and closes all windows of the application. This method does not necessarily force the application to exit. The Exit method is typically called from within a message loop, and forces Run to return. To exit a message loop for the current thread only, call ExitThread.
          /// @remarks Exit raises the following events and performs the associated conditional actions:
          /// * A FormClosing event is raised for every form represented by the OpenForms property. This event can be canceled by setting the Cancel property of their FormClosingEventArgs parameter to true.
          /// * If one of more of the handlers cancels the event, then Exit returns without further action. Otherwise, a FormClosed event is raised for every open form, then all running message loops and forms are closed.

          /// @remarks In a Win32-based or Windows Forms application, a message loop is a routine in code that processes user events, such as mouse clicks and keyboard strokes. Every running Windows-based application requires an active message loop, called the main message loop. When the main message loop is closed, the application exits. In Windows Forms, this loop is closed when the Exit method is called, or when the ExitThread method is called on the thread that is running the main message loop.
          /// @remarks Most Windows Forms developers will not need to use this version of the method. You should use the Run(Form) overload to start an application with a main form, so that the application terminates when the main form is closed. For all other situations, use the Run(ApplicationContext) overload, which supports supplying an ApplicationContext object for better control over the lifetime of the application.
