   *Remarks, this operation depand of your hardware and can be very long*

5. Enjoy and be creative with Switch ;-)

### Remarks

* Switch installer set cmake variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to "/usr/local" for generate, build and install Switch.
* When install is complete you can find installed Switch files in folder "/usr/local".
* To build your own project using Switch, don't miss to set cmake variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to "/usr/local"; otherwise cmake don't find Switch libraries and include files. See cmake documentation ([http://cmake.org/documentation](http://cmake.org/documentation)) for more information.

## macOS 10.11.5 (OS X El Capitan) or later

# Build and run your first Switch application

After downloading and install Switch you are ready to build and run your first application. We will call it SwitchConsole (or what you want).

This application is very simple and it composed of 2 files :

A source file SwitchConsole.cpp :

```c++
#include <Switch/Switch>

using namespace System;

namespace SwitchConsole {
  class Program {
  public:
    static void Main() {
      Console::WriteLine("My first switch application");
      Console::WriteLine();
    }
  };
}

startup_(SwitchConsole::Program);
```

A cmake file CMakeLists.txt :

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2)

Project(SwitchConsole)

find_package(Switch REQUIRED)
add_executable(SwitchConsole SwitchConsole.cpp)
target_link_libraries(SwitchConsole Switch.System)
```

## Build and run on Windows

To build this wonderful application, open "Command Prompt" and type following lines:

```shell
cd C:\Users\YourName\Projects\SwitchConsole
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
```

The SwitchConsle.sln file was generate, open it with VisualStudio 2017. Select SwitchConsole project and type Ctrl+F5 to build and run your first application.

## Build and run on macOS

To build this wonderful application, open "Terminal" and type following lines:

```shell
cd /Users/YourName/Projects/SwitchConsole
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Xcode"
```

The SwitchConsle.xcodeproj file was generate, open it with Xcode. Select SwitchConsole project and type Cmd+R to build and run your first application.

## Build and run on Linux

To build this wonderful application, open "Terminal" and type following lines:

```shell
cd /home/YourName/Projects/SwitchConsole
mkdir build
cd build
export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++
cmake ..
```

The makefile was generate, in the same "Terminal" type following lines to build and run your first application:

```shell
cmake --build . --config Release
./SwitchConsole
```

### Remarks

* If your application is unit tests application, is the same procedure but you must replace the line **target_link_libraries(SwitchConsole Switch.System)** by **target_link_libraries(SwitchConsole Switch.TUnit.Main)** if you don't have your own main entry point; or **target_link_libraries(SwitchConsole Switch.TUnit.Core)** it you have your own main entry point in **CMakeLists.txt** file.
* ​If your application is GUI application, is the same procedure but you must replace the line **add_executable(SwitchConsole SwitchConsole.cpp)** by **add_executable(SwitchConsole ${SWITCH_GUI} SwitchConsole.cpp)** and replace the line **target_link_libraries(SwitchConsole Switch.System)** by **target_link_libraries(SwitchConsole Switch.System.Windows.Forms)** in **CMakeLists.txt** file.
